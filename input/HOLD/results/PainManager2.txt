ReportRecommendation3Text=Per CDC guidelines, before starting, and periodically during opioid therapy, clinicians should discuss with patients known risks and realistic benefits of opioid therapy and patient and clinician responsibilities for managing therapy (recommendation category: A, evidence type: 3).  [CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline, Recommendation #3](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/rr/rr6501e1.htm)
ReportRecommendation5Text=null
ReportRecommendation8Text=Per CDC guidelines, before starting, and periodically during continuation of opioid therapy, clinicians should evaluate risk factors for opioid-related harms. Clinicians should incorporate into the management plan strategies to mitigate risk, including considering offering naloxone when factors that increase risk for opioid overdose, such as history of overdose, history of substance use disorder, higher opioid dosages (greater than or equal to [?] 50 morphine milligram equivalents [MME]/day), or concurrent benzodiazepine use, are present (recommendation category: A, evidence type: 4).
