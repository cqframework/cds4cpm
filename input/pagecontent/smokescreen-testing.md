# Smokescreen Testing
For the two pilots, RTI, Chicago, and Vanderbilt (henceforth referred to as the RTI pilot), and the University of Florida (referred to as the UF pilot) smoke screen testing was done. This was accomplished by creating test patients, with their FHIR resource bundles, based on the scenarios provided.
