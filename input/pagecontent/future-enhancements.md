#### Alignment with CIC Pain Assessment Project

The [CIC Pain Assessment Project](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CIC/Pain+Assessment) is working to build chronic pain assessment instruments that could inform the MyPAIN questionnaire.

The group as of the September 2020 HL7 WGM has completed work on a LOINC panel [Pain assessment panel 38212-7](https://loinc.org/38212-7/) that [renders in LHC](https://forms.loinc.org/38212-7). Their work on defining a complete set of profiles for the resulting observations for answered questions is not yet complete, but could form a solid basis for the observations derived from the instrument.

There may also be some alignment with our existing questions built inside this tool, for example [80340-3 Nonpharmacologic intervention for pain](https://loinc.org/80340-3/). Consider using this in a future revision of this work.
