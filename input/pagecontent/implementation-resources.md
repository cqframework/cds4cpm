## Implementation Resources

The following implementation resources are adapted from the CDS4CPM initial pilot sites and are being provided here to support future implementations of MyPAIN and PainManager. These types of site-oriented enriching materials are provided to assist with some of the toughest friction points of implementing new SMART-on-FHIR technologies. By supporting implementation sites with Implementation Guides augmented with implementation resources, interoperability teams will move FHIR technologies beyond demonstration projects into the production environment to achieve long term sustainability. 

### Use Case materials  

#### Use Cases 

Why this is helpful: Example use cases serve to extend the persona and detail specific aspects of workflow. In addition to input from implementing sites and the development team, use cases utilize clinician review to confirm the relevance of the intervention. Use cases also ensure that system requirements are met and can be fully tested, and they are the starting point for the data element crosswalk. 

Next steps: To the greatest extent possible, develop and utilize explicit use cases early to help establish requirements and guide progress in development.

#### Wireframes 

Why is this helpful: Wireframes provide an early visual example of what the application is supposed to look like, what it is supposed to do (what problem is it solving?) and how users might interact with it. This helps to quickly articulate the application look/feel and facilitate input from key stakeholders at implementation sites. By demonstrating how the application is situated in the information sharing space, wireframes also a preview into the workflow to support the intervention. 

Next steps: Wireframes are a key connection between the system integrators and the rest of the project. It is common to use wireframes as a scaffold to iteratively refine design aspects and validate these among different user groups.

#### Test Scripts 

Why is this helpful: Test scripts provide implementing sites with the ability to run explicit tests to ensure the system produces the expected outcome. This in turn uncovers flaws and plays a part in the iterative development process. Test scripts are often developed by the implementing site, with guidance from the development team. Changes to the personas have a cascading (and reciprocal) effect through to the test scripts. 

Next steps: Before using test scripts, prepare implementation sites to anticipate testing needs and unanticipated errors (e.g., data not being pulled in and/or presented) and plan the timeline accordingly.

<!-- #### Evaluation Components 

Why this is helpful: Evaluation forms a critical piece of the artifact lifecycle by providing the evidence that informs the revision of an artifact or an implementation. Evaluation components include planned activities associated with capturing data to inform the evaluation and a summary report that describes lessons learned for future implementations. The evaluation plan is often developed and shared among site implementers and the development team. Settling the plans for evaluation plan to include examples of data output allows the teams to plan for capture, testing, review and analysis of the data. 

Next steps: There needs to be a mechanism for how evaluation data will inform updates to the IG. The development of this mechanism may lie with standards development groups.
