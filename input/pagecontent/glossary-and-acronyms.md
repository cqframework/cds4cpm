**Patient advocate feedback**: an opportunity for a panel of patient advocates to review and provide feedback on a production-level MyPAIN (version 1, release 1); the panel provided feedback on the app’s look and feel, which resulted in some adjustments to the app

**Patient population testing**: a method of testing a software system using a synthetic set of patient population data to verify that the system behaves as expected

**Pilot go-live (PGL)**: the date on which production-level applications are made available to patients and clinicians within live clinic workflows for the duration of the 2-month “pilot period”

**Pilot period**: the time during which the applications are available within live clinic workflows and data are collected to track applications’ use

**Plumbing test:** more commonly known as an “end-to-end” test

**Public good**: a commodity or service that is provided to all members of a society by the government or a private individual or organization; in many cases, these services are free, cost controlled, or obtainable at low cost

**Regression testing**: testing that is done to verify that a code change in the software does not affect the product’s existing functionality

**Requirement**: a condition or capability needed by a user to solve a problem or achieve an objective

**Service**: centrally managed software that provides some logic or functionality to end users, which a user accesses (via application programming interface, website, etc.)

**Shareability**: the extent to which application artifacts, such as implementation guides, and lessons learned are made available to other clinicians or clinics interested in implementing the application in different geographic settings. This can be accomplished by posting to a repository which explicitly allows and/or supports sharing 

**Shared decision making (SDM)**: a model of patient-centered care that enables and encourages people to play a role in the medical decisions that affect their health
