## Related CDS Content for Pain Management

The development of the CDS4CPM artifacts included a review and assessment of related CDS content for pain management. The review below details the differences between the CDS content
found in the [AHRQ CDS Pain Management Summary tool](https://github.com/AHRQ-CDS/AHRQ-CDS-Connect-PAIN-MANAGEMENT-SUMMARY)
and the [Opioid Prescribing Support Implementation Guide](https://github.com/cqframework/opioid-cds).

### Opioid Prescribing Support Implementation Guide

The Opioid Prescribing Support Implementation Guide is a joint effort by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT (ONC) focused on improving processes for the development of standardized, shareable, computable decision support artifacts using the [CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/rr/rr6501e1.htm?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fmmwr%2Fvolumes%2F65%2Frr%2Frr6501e1er.htm) as a model case.

The guide currently includes artifacts to support all 12 recommendations contained in the CDC Opioid Guideline. However, only recommendations 3, 8, 10, and 11 are used for this review.

#### Opioid Review Useful
{: #opioid-review-useful}

Patient is 18 years old or older without the following:
- Findings of limited life expectancy conditions
- Orders for therapies indicating end-of-life care in past 90 days
- Active cancer treatment or conditions that are likely terminal for opioid prescribing

**Data Elements**

```
[Condition: "Limited life expectancy conditions"] where clinicalStatus is 'active'
[ProcedureRequest: "Therapies indicating end of life care"] where status is 'active' or 'completed' in past 90 days
[Condition: "Conditions likely terminal for opioid prescribing"] where clinicalStatus is 'active'
```

#### Active Cancer Treatment
{: #active-cancer-treatment}

Patient has not had two distinct encounters within a year of the current visit with a diagnosis in the CDC Malignant Cancer Conditions value set.

**Data Elements**

```

```

#### Chronic Pain
{: #chronic-pain}
Determining whether a patient is being prescribed opioids for chronic pain is difficult to determine by examination of the medical record alone. The project team identified the following proxies for chronic pain, used throughout the recommendations:

1. A medication is considered for chronic pain if it is being prescribed for 28 days or more.

1. A medication is considered for acute pain if it is being prescribed for less than 28 days.

**Data Elements**

```
[MedicationRequest: "Opioid analgesics with ambulatory misuse potential"] where status is 'active' and category is "Community" and dispenseRequest.expectedSupplyDuration >= 28 days
```

"Community": 'community' from http://hl7.org/fhir/medication-request-category
```

#### Recommendation 3
Before starting and periodically during opioid therapy, clinicians should
discuss with patients known risks and realistic benefits of opioid therapy
and patient and clinician responsibilities for managing therapy
(recommendation category: A, evidence type: 3).

```

**Terminology Elements**

```
"Opioid counseling procedure": 'http://fhir.org/guides/cdc/opioid-cds/ValueSet/opioid-counseling-procedure'
```

#### Recommendation 8
Before starting and periodically during continuation of opioid therapy, clinicians should evaluate risk factors for opioid-related harms. Clinicians should incorporate into the management plan strategies to mitigate risk, including considering offering naloxone when factors that increase risk for opioid overdose, such as history of overdose, history of substance use disorder, higher opioid dosages (â‰¥50 MME/day), or concurrent benzodiazepine use, are present (recommendation category: A, evidence type: 4).

#### Recommendation 10
When prescribing opioids for chronic pain, providers should use urine drug testing before starting opioid therapy and consider urine drug testing at least annually to assess for prescribed medications as well as other controlled prescription drugs and illicit drugs (recommendation category: B, evidence type: 4).

Active Subroutines:
- [Chronic Pain](#chronic-pain)

### AHRQ CDS Pain Management Summary Tool

The Pain Management Summary artifact provides relevant information to consider when managing a patient's pain. This CDS logic was informed by the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain. The CDS is not a direct representation of any one recommendation statement within the guideline. Instead, the CDS compiles clinical concepts mentioned throughout the guideline in one consolidated summary for clinician review.

This tool returns a "summary" object, which represents the full Pain Management Summary to be displayed to the clinician. All values are returned as user-friendly text representations.
